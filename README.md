# Pang Arcade Game - Localized Java Edition

This is a modernized and localized version of the classic **Pang Arcade Game**, developed as a school project at **Yeditepe University**. The game brings the classic "bubble-popping" mechanic to various iconic Turkish cities, combining high-paced gameplay with core software engineering principles.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Localized Experience:** Battle through levels featuring backgrounds from **Istanbul, Ankara, Antalya, Adana, and Göbeklitepe**.
* **Dynamic Gameplay:** Includes multi-level support, increasing difficulty levels, and a user-friendly login/registration system.
* **Sound & Visuals:** Integrated custom sound effects (`pop.wav`, `music.wav`) and responsive sprite animations for the player.
* **Progress Tracking:** Local history management system that records user scores and game sessions.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation (OOP Focus)
The project serves as a showcase for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** excellence in Java:
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Used for dynamic entity management, allowing different game objects (Bubbles, Bullets, Player) to interact within a unified framework.
* **Encapsulation:** Core game logic is protected within specific classes like `GamePanel` and `Player` to ensure maintainability.
* **Event Handling:** Custom logic for collision detection between projectiles and bubbles of varying sizes.
* **Data Management:** Implemented file I/O operations for saving user credentials and session histories.

## 📁 Project Structure
* `src/`: Contains the Java source code (.java files).
* `assets/`: Visual and audio resources, including level backgrounds and sprites.
* `histories/`: User-specific game history records (ignored in version control).
